The AI had been generating stupid commit names. I asked it to go back and fix
them up, and it complained that it was tedious. It decided to write a bash
script to bulk-edit the messages.

The script mangled all the names. I redid the whole thing myself in Emacs in
about 20 seconds. It was indeed tedious.

Model used: Pony Alpha.
