The AI had been generating stupid commit names. I asked it to go back and fix
them up, and it complained that the task was tedious. Then it tried to
automate it anyway and proceeded to mess everything up.

The script mangled all the names. I redid the whole thing myself in Emacs in
about 20 seconds. What good are AI bots if they complain about tedious tasks?

Model used: Pony Alpha.
