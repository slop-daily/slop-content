# Contributing

## Post format

Posts are Markdown files stored at `posts/YYYY/MM/slug.md`.

Required frontmatter fields:

- `title`
- `date`
- `tags` (at least one tag, used as series)
- `author`
- `excerpt`
- `tool`

Optional fields:

- `featured` (true/false)
- `codeLanguage`
- `canonical`
- `originalSource`

## Tips

- Keep excerpts under 300 characters.
- Provide enough context to understand the failure.
- Remove any sensitive data from snippets.
